This will work for any wireless headset that cuts out after a few minutes
if it doesn't receive an audio signal.

You can change the interval of the sound injection in the settings.conf
file by editing the value on the end of "timer-interval-millis=", to any
value in milliseconds that you'd like.  The settings.conf file must be in
the same directory of the program!

Windows service version coming soon!

Good luck ;)
